Not sure ChanStripDlg.closeShow method required?

What to work on next?
- Add open show to CueEngine
- Add cue modification?
    Probably want this to be a dialog that be called from CueEngine and ShowMixer

**** For now: Make it all work for the X32, then think about something for Yamaha and MIDI ****

Check out Show object in CueEngine.py to confirm adds did last session.
I set channel count in CueList call in Show to 0 since CueEngine should know nothing about the mixer. ????
