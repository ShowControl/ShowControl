Not sure ChanStripDlg.closeShow method required?

What to work on next?
- Add open show to CueEngine
- Add cue modification?
    Probably want this to be a dialog that be called from CueEngine and ShowMixer

**** For now: Make it all work for the X32, then think about something for Yamaha and MIDI ****

Check out Show object in CueEngine.py to confirm adds did last session.
I set channel count in CueList call in Show to 0 since CueEngine should know nothing about the mixer. ????

Now that we can read files

Updated ShowMixer.py <class ChanStripDlg> added initlevels()
Aded line to main to initialize the levels.
In Cue.py added levdic dictionary of levels for each channel of the cue.
Action needed:
Add level entity in Paulie_cues_w_cuetypes.xml
Confirm lev dic for all cues in cue list
modify on_buttonNext_clicked in <class ChanStripDlg> to handle setting levels when cue is activated.

Still need to separate "mixer" from "cues". Cues currently need to know the chan/charcount
Possibly, remove current cue state from CueList and inherit CueList then add cuestate to
Compare differences in ShowMixer/Cues.py and CueEngine/Cues.py. In CueEngine/Cues.py it handles the writing of cues
when a cue is edited.

Tons of cleanup and simplifications.
I think I have successfully removed the link between cues and mixer.
Now need to moves Cues.py to ShowControl/utils and get CueEngine working

Mon Jan 16 11:19:37 EST 2017
CuesEngine.py and ShowMixer.py now refer to /ShowControl/utils/Show.py and /ShowControl/utils/Cues.py
CueEngine.py can now launch and close Shows.py
CueEngine.py/on_table_click needs some work so the selected cue is executed when Jump button is clicked.
(Figure out what happen to the icons in CueEngine...)

When I updated the CueEngine ui file it was pointing to the ~/.designer/backup folder for the icons. Don't know why.
Fixed that an all is good.
Added toggle of mixer app from menubar.

Had a look at how to use resource files
In QtDesigner select the Resource Browser tab and click edit (the pencil icon)
When you add a resource file from the resulting dialog it creates a xxx.qrc file.
You then select the resources, icons, etc. they are automatically part of the qrc file.
Once you save the .ui file in QtDesigner then use the following to produce the ui .py and rc.py files:
Example at the command line:
pyuic5 CueEngine-3_w_res.ui -o CueEngine_ui.py
pyrcc5 CueEngine_rsrc.qrc -o CueEngine_rsrc_rc.py

If you check the CueEngine_ui.py file you'll see this:
import CueEngine_rsrc_rc

Updated CueEngine to handle visibility of different cue types.
some issues here because cue number and table index no longer track. This is fixed in Jump and Next, not Previous

Created example code to use jack midi and rtmidi(alsa) now need to update ShowControl/utils/CommHandlers.py to have
JACK and ALSA midi capabilities.
