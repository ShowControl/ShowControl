Not sure ChanStripDlg.closeShow method required?

What to work on next?
- Add open show to CueEngine
- Add cue modification?
    Probably want this to be a dialog that be called from CueEngine and ShowMixer

**** For now: Make it all work for the X32, then think about something for Yamaha and MIDI ****

Check out Show object in CueEngine.py to confirm adds did last session.
I set channel count in CueList call in Show to 0 since CueEngine should know nothing about the mixer. ????

Updated ShowMixer.py <class ChanStripDlg> added initlevels()
Aded line to main to initialize the levels.
In Cue.py added levdic dictionary of levels for each channel of the cue.
Action needed:
Add level entity in Paulie_cues_w_cuetypes.xml
Confirm lev dic for all cues in cue list
modify on_buttonNext_clicked in <class ChanStripDlg> to handle setting levels when cue is activated.

Still need to separate "mixer" from "cues". Cues currently need to know the chan/charcount
Possibly, remove current cue state from CueList and inherit CueList then add cuestate to
Compare differences in ShowMixer/Cues.py and CueEngine/Cues.py. In CueEngine/Cues.py it handles the writing of cues
when a cue is edited.

Tons of cleanup and simplifications.
I think I have successfully removed the link between cues and mixer.
Now need to moves Cues.py to ShowControl/utils and get CueEngine working

Mon Jan 16 11:19:37 EST 2017
CuesEngine.py and ShowMixer.py now refer to /ShowControl/utils/Show.py and /ShowControl/utils/Cues.py
CueEngine.py can now launch and close Shows.py
CueEngine.py/on_table_click needs some work so the selected cue is executed when Jump button is clicked.
(Figure out what happen to the icons in CueEngine...)

When I updated the CueEngine ui file it was pointing to the ~/.designer/backup folder for the icons. Don't know why.
Fixed that an all is good.
Added toggle of mixer app from menubar.
